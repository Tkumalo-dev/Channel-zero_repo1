            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>When individuals pass away, they often leave inheritances for their loved ones in their wills. However, some assets may be unintentionally excluded, leading to unclaimed funds that remain undistributed.</p>
            <p>These unclaimed assets can include pension monies, stocks, and other financial instruments. Without a centralized system to track these assets, beneficiaries may remain unaware of their rightful claims, sometimes for years or even decades.</p>

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>Our platform features a dual-sided approach:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>A dedicated interface for companies to maintain and update their records of unclaimed benefits</li>
                <li>A user-friendly portal for individuals to search and verify if they are potential beneficiaries using the company-provided data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates a win-win situation where companies can fulfill their obligations while individuals can easily discover and claim what's rightfully theirs.</p>
